    <h1>Installing JPO on Windows</h1>

    <p>Visit the SourceForge.net download page by clicking this green button. Note that the download starts directly
    after 5 seconds. Install the application like any other windows application. You can remove it just like any
    other windows application by opening the Start menu, clicking on the cogwheel icon (Settings), choosing Apps
    in the Settings Window that opens up, scroll down to JPO and there click on the Uninstall button.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/j-po/files">SourceForge download area</a></p>

   <p>Then install the downloaded file and you will find a JPO icon in your Start Menu and on your Desktop. JPO installs
   istelf into c:\Program Files\JPO</p>

    <h4>Scary Warnings - Unknown publisher</h4>

    <p>Sorry, I have not yet figured out how to digitally sign my packages so Windows insists on splashing up
    a scary warning. If you know how I can improve this user experience, please let me know.</p>

    <p>I can assure you that JPO doesn't spy on you, doesn't send spam and doesn't try to sell you 
        anything. Better than that, it's open source software so you or someone you trust can go and
        analyse the lines of source code and compile your own version! Check out the linked code analysis tool reports to see
        how JPO is doing in terms of code quality, test coverage and other developer metrics.</p>
