        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The Java Picture Organizer application is a platform independent image organisation tool
            that lets a user build collections of images that they can then search, browse,
            show, reorganize and share with others. An HTML export facility is available that allows
            web pages to be built from collections. Emails with pictures can be sent, located on a Google
            Map. JPO uses an open XML file format to store
            collection information. Picture groups can be exported to a directory for backups
            and sharing by other means. JPO supports many picture formats.</p>
