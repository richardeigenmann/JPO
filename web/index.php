    <p>JPO is a program that helps you organise your digital pictures by putting them in
        collections. There you can browse the pictures, skip through the thumbnails, share
        them by email or upload to Google Picasa. A powerful picture viewer allows you to 
        see the pictures full screen with simple Zoom-in and Zoom-out with the left and 
        right mouse buttons.</p>

    <p>A fundamental design principle is that JPO doesn't mess with your pictures. They 
        stay unchanged on your disk unless you ask JPO to move them somewhere or to delete them.</p>

    <p>JPO is not a photo editing application. There are many excellent packages out there
        with which you can touch up your pictures. You can make JPO open such a program 
        for you.</p>

    <p>Richard Eigenmann from Z&uuml;rich has spent the last 18 years building and improving
        JPO as an OpenSource project. He hopes you will find it useful and enjoys feedback.</p>

    <h3>Reviews</h3>
    <p>I was totally amazed when I discovered that people were writing reviews about
        JPO and positive reviews at that!</p>
    <p>
        The Agfanet review is no longer online but an archived version can be read 
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040530180350/http://www.agfanet.com.isp.de/en/cafe/softreview/cont_softreview.php3?id=257&archive=yes">here.</a>

    <p>The Java Picture Organizer application is a platform independent image organisation tool
        that lets a user build collections of images that they can then search, browse,
        show and share with others. An HTML export facility is available that allows
        web pages to be built from collections. JPO uses an open XML file format to store
        collection information. Picture groups can be exported to a directory for CD burning
        and sharing by other means. JPO supports all picture formats of your Java installation.
        By default this is JPEG and GIF. The application makes use of Sun's Java Web Start (TM)
        technology for easy installation and upgrading.</p>
